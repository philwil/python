Someone can't create an instance of your SpecialDict as a dictionary literal, because a dictionary literal is just that; a normal dictionary.

As far as setting items with square bracket notation, as in mySpecialDict['hello'] = 54, that just corresponds to mySpecialDict.__setitem__('hello', 54). Likewise retrieving an item with the square bracket notation corresponds to an invocation of the __getitem__ method. This is true no matter what class mySpecialDict is; whether it's an ordinary dictionary, a class that subclasses the builtin dict, or some entirely unrelated class. So you can just implement those methods to change what they do (using super(SpecialDict, self).__setitem__(key, value) or dict.__setitem__(self, key, value) to refer to the normal implementation, when you need to).

One problem you will run into is that some (all?) of the builtin implementation of other dict methods will not respect your overridden __setitem__ or __getitem__. So you won't be able to inherit them; you'll have to override all of them and either completely re-implement them in terms of your versions of the basic operations, or at least run your validations "around" the superclass calls.

A much less painful approach might actually be to not subclass the builtin dict, and instead implement a custom "dict-like" object that wraps an ordinary dictionary, using the collections.Mapping or collections.MutableMapping base classes to get the dictionary interface. Using this approach you'll only need to implement about 6 basic methods yourself (which you'd do by plugging in your validation logic around calls to the wrapped dictionary), and get sensible definitions of other methods based on them.
